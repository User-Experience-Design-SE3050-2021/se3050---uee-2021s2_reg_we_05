project is on 'eTraffic Police' Application

“eTraffic Police” is an application developed by the Sri Lankan Traffic Police
which allows the public to report traffic violations by uploading images or 
videos taken through the application as evidence which is sent to the database
in the traffic HQ in real time with the location, and the user can also choose 
to add a description/comment regrading the violation. All this information is 
received by the police IT division and traffic HQ where the operations team can 
initiate whatever the action that is required. And once the case is resolved, 
the user will be notified with the status of the action
